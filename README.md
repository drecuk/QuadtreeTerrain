# QuadtreeTerrain
Quadtree Terrain Rendering System with Simple Features: C++, OpenGL, SDL

### Topic: Object-Oriented C++ integration with SDL and OpenGL for Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)
### Author: Eugene Ch'ng [Academic Blog](http://www.complexity.io/)
### Purpose: Prepared for the ERC Advanced Research Grant 'Lost Frontiers' Scalable Agent-Based Modelling Team Training.
### Audience: For students and researchers needing a quick approach to learning agent-based modelling foundation for C++ and OpenGL

## INTRODUCTION
This is a continuation of the series of C++ code in my repositories for the ERC 'Lost Frontiers' Advanced Research Grant. The Quadtree Terrain System is composed of a set of decoupled classes, each for managing objects within the ABM system.
